    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science that measures how efficient an algorithm is in terms of execution time. An efficient algorithm runs in minimal time while processing large inputs.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires during execution. It is commonly represented using Big-O notation, such as O(n), to describe how space usage grows with input size.</p>
